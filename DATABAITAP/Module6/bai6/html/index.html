      This weekend's special bunch
      
      This weekend, our season of special brunches continues with scrambled egg on an English muffin.      </p>
    <p>Not for the faint-hearted, the secret to these eggs is that they are made with half cream and 
      cooked in butter, with no more than four eggs in the pan at a time. </p>
