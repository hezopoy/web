Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing success!
 After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off.
 I have gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.
I've started putting up a slide show of the production.
Please feel free to download the files from the Web site. If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please contact me.

Once again: BRAVO!!! -- Mrs. Juroszek
